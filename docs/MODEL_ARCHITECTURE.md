## Model Training Pipeline

### 1. Data Preparation
```python
# Example training script structure
from src.models.cnn_models import ScalpCNN, HairHealthCNN
from src.models.model_manager import ModelManager

# Load and preprocess data
train_loader, val_loader = prepare_data()

# Initialize models
scalp_model = ScalpCNN(num_classes=6)
hair_model = HairHealthCNN(num_classes=6)

# Train models
train_model(scalp_model, train_loader, val_loader)
train_model(hair_model, train_loader, val_loader)
```
