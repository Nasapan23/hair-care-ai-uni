First do annotations for only 3 classes:

**1. Dandruff:** closed shaped objects, bright white, non-uniform with rest of the scalp, that look like speck of dust, annotate dandruff on both scalp and the big ones on hair strands

**2. Oiliness:** shiny big patches on scalp/only on scalp
 
**3. Senstive:** any red/orange/brown/scar patches
 
**4. Null Image:**  Images with no objects will be marked null
